# The Slowhelix Project #

## Introduction ##
The Slowhelix project is an experiment to try and recreate slowloris
in python3. The project gained inspiration from a demonstration of another
slowloris clone. Slowhelix is probably not as good as the original slowloris
and that is understandable. It was not designed to be the best at what it
does. Maybe in time it might grow and become more refined but that is not 
what the goal of this project is. It is as stated before as a personal 
challenge to try and recreate the effect slowloris has. In this it is 
successful. It was originally written in python2 however because Posiden
had a CS class that required he know python3 it was rewritten.

## Requirments ##
python 3.x

## Usage ##
It is really really easy to use mostly because a lot of configurable values
are hard coded into the program. (this maybe change with time).

python slowhelix.py the.target.host

## Notes ##
This script was written purely as an educational excercise. The author(s) 
do not condone the use of this script to DoS web servers. That may be its
purpose in being created however doing it as a controlled test of knowledge
is very different then using it to malicously harm a website.

## Acknowledgments ##
I would like to acknowledge the writer of the original slowloris.pl script
and the other clone which inspired this version.
